# Yes, this mechanic is extremely simple to disable, but if I find you using my work without credit again I will simply copyright claim the video.
# The download page and copyright notice in the zip file clearly state that crediting is mandatory when publishing videos about my datapacks.

# @Steveee I noticed and appreciated you crediting me in your hidden tree door video. Channel-url is a good start but please also include the download-link so people can easily find it.
# Looking forward to hopefully removing you from the list in the future if you continue to properly credit.
